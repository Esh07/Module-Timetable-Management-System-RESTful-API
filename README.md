## Introduction

During my journey of learning Spring Boot, Spring Web, and RESTful API development, I took on the challenge of developing a module timetable management system for the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of Spring Boot and RESTful API development to a real-world scenario, and I was able to learn more about the Spring framework and its capabilities.

The primary objective of this project was to design and implement an API that organizes and manages module timetables, focusing on convenor information, modules taught, and the sessions delivered within each module.
