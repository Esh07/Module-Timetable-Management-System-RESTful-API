  title: Timetable System REST API
  description: >-
    This is a simple timetable system for The School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk) to organise and manage modules\' timetables. Its keeps track of convenors, the  modules  they  teach,  and  the  sessions  delivered  in  each  module.
    <br />
    <br />
    Below is detailed documentation of all end points, parameters, error messages available in the Timetable system.
